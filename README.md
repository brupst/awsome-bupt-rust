## Resources

### Books

- [《The Rust Programming Language》](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Affectionately nicknamed “the book,” The Rust Programming Language will give you an overview of the language from first principles. You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of the language.
- [《Futures Explained in 200 Lines of Rust》](https://cfsamson.github.io/books-futures-explained/) - This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach, exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work.

### Information

- [Rust 语言中文社区](https://rustcc.cn/) — 为数不多且较为活跃的 Rust 中文社区，会定期发布 Rust 周报和日报。
- [Stjepan's blog](https://stjepang.github.io/) — A blog about async runtimes and concurrency primitives in Rust.
